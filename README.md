# SEP11 Freedom Project
by **Benjamin Chau**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP11 is a year-long project all about making something using JavaScript along with a third-party JS tool.

For my project, I chose to independently study **React** in order to help me contrivbute to **the front end of my group's grading website**.

## Implications
##### PROS
* The website can be a personal reminder to **individuals** about their assignments and allow them to check their grades.
* Ricegrades can be apart of **school systems** as a gradebook
* The grading website can help develop **relationships** between students and teachers about their grades
* Ricegrades can support teachers in the **jobs** by informing students about how they're doing in class
* Just like other grade books, Ricegrades may promote an **environment** of competitiveness for the students.
##### CONS
* The website can promote a **culture** of constantly staring into the screen for grades to update
* This grade book can **financially** aid schools that may not be able to pay for subscriptions of other grade books
