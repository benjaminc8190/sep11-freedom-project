## **Takeaways:**

### **In-class presentation:**

The in-class presentation did not went as I expected because there were some ways I did better than I thought while some ways I did worse than I have planned. I felt well prepared and was actually confident in the beginning. However, as I presented the confidence shifted to anxiety. I was fine staring at the screen and my notes to introduce React strongly, but it all changed when I tried to make some eye contact. The shift in focus made me more anxious to finish presenting the project since I felt uncomfortable looking at others while presenting. As a result, I missed some key points such as mentioning how I planned to React relate to problem decomposition. A takeaway I have for myself is to maintain eye contact in a comfortable manner. I should try to get used it by starting with friends and then applying it to when I'm presenting.

### **Expo Elevator pitch:**

In the expo, I felt very overwhelmed when presenting to the judges thus I kept staring at my screen without making a single eye contact with the judges.

## **EDP**:

After the sixth and seventh steps for the engineering design process, in which I fixed minor bugs and added images from the feedback of my peers, this is the eighth step of the process. My group and I **communicated** the website by giving an elevator pitch for judges and presented our project to the class.

## **Skills**:

Some skills I practiced and solidified during these presentation were **consideration** and **communication**. The in-class presentation helped me practice public speaking about my idea. Also while I was presenting to others in the expo, I was challenged to think about how Ricegrades will impact those that use it. Such as how the game will motivate students to maintain an average above 80.
