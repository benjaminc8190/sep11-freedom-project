# Entry 6
##### 5/24/24


## **Takeaways:**

### **In-class presentation:**



### **Expo Elevator pitch:**



## **EDP**:

After the sixth and seventh steps for the engineering design process, in which I fixed minor bugs and added images from the feedback of my peers, this is the eighth step of the process. My group and I **communicated** the website by giving an elevator pitch for judges and presented our project to the class.

## **Skills**:

Some skills I practiced and solidified during these presentation were **consideration** and **communication**. The in-class presentation helped me practice public speaking about my idea. Also while I was presenting to others in the expo, I was challenged to think about how Ricegrades will impact those that use it. Such as how the game will motivate students to maintain an average above 80.
