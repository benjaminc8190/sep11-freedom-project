## **Minimum Viable Product Check-in**:

The MVP, the bear-bones of our website, is finished - my partners and I have been working on it throughout April to get our grading website to work. There, however, are still some improvements that can be made such as making the student and teachers look better by fitting the theme of our website rather than black and white blobs of texts. We are also thinking of making an assignments system so that the teacher can name the assignments rather than just typing in a grade for the students.

## **Tool**:

As we have been completing the MVP, I continued to learn my tool through some more [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react) lessons. 

## **EDP**:

This is the fifth step of the engineering design process. Our MVP is the prototype of our project because it is functioning the way we want it to. We are testing by making alternate accounts to view the teacher and student pages to see what improvements need to be made such as adding css to make the pages look better. We are also looking for pictures to put on the homepage of our website.

## **Skills**:
