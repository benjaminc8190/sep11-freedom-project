## **Minimum Viable Product Check-in**:

The MVP, the bear-bones of our website, is finished - my partners and I have been working on it throughout April to get our grading website to work. There, however, are still some improvements that can be made such as making the student and teachers look better by fitting the theme of our website rather than black and white blobs of texts. We are also thinking of making an assignments system so that the teacher can name the assignments rather than just typing in a grade for the students.

## **Tool**:

As we have been completing the MVP, I continued to learn my tool through some more [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react) lessons. 

## **EDP**:
